# QRecon Project
A dive into IoT QR code behavior.


## What exactly is this?
 This project aims to provide insight into the security of IoT devices by using QR codes. How many IoT cameras follow QR links they see? And can this be used for code execution? These are questions that I have not heard asked before and want to know the answer to. In short, what is the exact behavior and processes, if any, that QR codes go through once scanned? 
 
 
 
 ## Yeah Ok, but why?
This started as a bit. I thought it would be cool to measure how many people would scan a QR code temporary tattooed on the back of my neck. But then the thought occured of how many IoT devices actively look follow QR links and what are the implications for security if this is the case? 



## How?
I'll be using a physical QR code linked to an analytics page on my site. The site will have some google analytics running as well as [AmIJesse's Linkbait script](https://github.com/AmIJesse/LinkBait/).
